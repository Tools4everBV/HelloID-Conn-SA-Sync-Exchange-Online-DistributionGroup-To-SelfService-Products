## Introduction
By using this connector, you will have the ability to create HelloId SelfService Products based on Exchange Online Distribution Groups. It manages only the products of the target system. The existing and manually created products are unmanaged and excluded from the sync.

The created Self-service Products are intended to manage the permissions of the Exchange Distribution Groups. For each mailbox, there will be one or more self-service products created. Depending on the number of permission types you specify.
The name of the products will be Mailbox name + the type of permission. Example : "Accounting Department - FullAccess" or "Accounting Department - SendOnBehalf"
Optionally, you can include an Email action.


## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Make sure you have Windows PowerShell 5.1 installed on the server where the HelloID agent and Service Automation agent are running.
  > The connector is compatible with older versions of Windows PowerShell. Although we cannot guarantuee the compatibility.
- [ ] Installed and available [Microsoft Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps)
- [ ] To manage users, mailboxes and groups, the service account has to have the role "**Exchange Administrator**" assigned.
- [ ] Required to run **On-Premises** since it is not allowed to import a module with the Cloud Agent.
- [ ] Define the Global variables for your Exchange Environment

### Connection settings

The connection settings are defined in the automation variables [user defined variables](https://docs.helloid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014169933-How-to-Create-and-Manage-User-Defined-Variables). And the Product configuration can be configured in the script

## Remarks

    > The Update take will place for the configured Product settings and PowerShell Actions, but not for the Email actions (since there is no update API for Email actions).
- When the RemoveProduct switch is adjusted to remove the products. The products will be delete from HelloID instead of Disable. This will remove also the previous disabled products (by the sync).
- When the overwriteExistingProduct switch is adjusted to overwrite the existing products, this will be performed for all products created from this sync. This will update also the previous disabled products (by the sync).
- When the overwriteExistingProductAction switch is adjusted to overwrite the existing product actions, this will be performed for all products created from this sync. This will update also the previous disabled products (by the sync).
    > The Update will only take place for PowerShell actions. This will not take place for the Email actions (since there is no update API for Email actions).
- The managers of the sharedmailboxes are not added in the "Resource Owner Group" of the products
- The Unique identifier (CombineduniqueId / SKU)   is builded as follows:
  $SKUPrefix + GUID of the sharedmailboxes without dashes + Abbreviation of the permission Type
